### 2_prepare_deconvolution.R
### 
### This script creates a single-cell/single-nucleus reference matrix for use as input into
### InstaPrism. It requires single cell RNA sequencing data of HGSOC
### (from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE217517) and cell type labels
### for those cells (from https://github.com/greenelab/deconvolution_pilot/tree/main/data/cell_labels).
### It also requires single nucleus RNA sequencing data of adipocytes
### (from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE176171). Please refer to the
### “Input and output data preparation and organization” subsection of README for specific
### files necessary. It reads in the HGSOC single cell and adipocyte single nucleus RNA
### sequencing data and performs some pre-processing on the adipocyte data (removing duplicate
### samples, removing non-adipocyte nuclei, removing samples with many mitochondrial gene
### reads, and using Seurat to remove low-quality nuclei, empty droplets, and nuclei
### doublets/multiplets). It then combines the single cell and single nucleus data to
### generate an expression matrix where each row corresponds to a gene (GeneCards symbols)
### and each column corresponds to a sample (each assigned a unique numerical ID). It also
### generates a cell type file which serves as a key, and associates each sample ID to
### its cell type.
